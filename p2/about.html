                Located in the heart of Duluth, Minnesota, Sun 
                Bread Bakery is bringing a modern touch to the 
                classic bakery. Surround by history, Duluth brings 
                people from all over the world to explore the Lake
                Superior wilderness, and see the boat canals.<br>
                <br>
                Here at Sun Bread we are inspired by a broad range
                of sources, and wanted to represent it in our bakery.
                We belive every flavor has a story, and itâ€™s our job to
                tell it through our bakes. We look to nature for form, 
                shape, and textures to use within our baking, as well
                as the enviornment we work. Inspired by the people 
                we meet, and the places we travel, we encorporate 
                new flavors and techniqes into our menu to keep it 
                alive. <br>
                <br>
                By bringing a new and modern touch to classic baked
                goods, our goal is to enrich the flavor, but keep the
                comfort of a classic dish. Come on by and enjoy 
                coffee with a loved one, or pick up some treats to go. 
                Regardless, our baked goods are sure to add a little 
                sunshine to your day.
