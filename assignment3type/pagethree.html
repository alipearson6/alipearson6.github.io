            A Blooming Sunflower</h1>

        <p class="bodycopy">
        Once your sunflower is in full bloom, you’ll have around 20 days<br>
        to enjoy the beauty of the flower. The blooming phase provides <br>
        the opportunity for bees to pollinate the flower and fertilize <br>
        the seeds. When the back of the sunflower head turns yellow, <br>
        you’ll know the seeds are ripening.
         <br>
         <br>
        The blooming phase is the best time to take advantage of your <br>
        sunflower’s yellow blooms. You can put your flowers in a vase, <br>
        gift them in a bouquet or make a wreath for the fall.

            Harvesting Phase</h2>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p class="bodycopy">
        To harvest the seeds of your sunflower, wait until your sunflower <br>
        droops and turns brown. Then, cut the stem leaving four inches from<br>
        the head of the sunflower. You must store the sunflower head upside<br>
        down in a dry and breathable bag.
        <br>
        Your seeds should be ready to harvest within 110 to 125 days after <br>
        you planted the flower. This means that if you planted your seeds in <br>
        May, your sunflower will die in early or mid-August and you should <br>
        have ready-to-harvest seeds in late-August or September. Because <br>
        sunflowers are annual plants, they must be replanted year after year.
