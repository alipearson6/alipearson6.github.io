        Sunflowers are famous for their tall stems and bright, yellow blooms. Aside from the flower’s beauty, <br>
        its seeds are highly nutritious. Although sunflowers grow best in full sun, they’re a tough plant and <br>
        can withstand dry climates and most soil types. Beginner and experienced gardeners alike will enjoy the <br>
        minimal care required to grow a sunflower from a seedling to full maturity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sunflowers bloom throughout the summer and early fall. You can read through the various phases of a <br>
        sunflower’s life cycle to learn how to harvest and use sunflowers in everyday life. Gifting sunflowers,<br>
        for example, is a great way to show a friend or loved one how much you care. The vibrant color of this <br>
        well-known plant will surely brighten any room. <br>

            All Begins With a Seed

         Germination </h2>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p class= "bodycopy">
        Once you plant your sunflower seeds, the germination <br>
        phase of the flower’s life cycle will begin. This phase<br>
        takes up to eight days. During germination, roots will<br>
        develop from the seed and a shoot will push through the <br>
        surface of the soil. The shoot is looking for sunlight <br>
        because all plants need sunlight to grow. Germination <br>
        usually occurs from mid-April to late-May, depending on <br>
        when you plant your seeds.

            Vegetative Phase </h2>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p class="bodycopy">
        After germination, the vegetative phase of the sunflower’s <br>
        life cycle occurs. Your plant will still be a seedling for <br>
        close to 13 days after it breaks through the soil. This <br>
        initial part of the vegetative phase is called vegetative <br>
        emergence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the plant forms its first leaf that’s at least four <br>
        centimeters long, the plant is officially in vegetative <br>
        stage one. When the plant grows two leaves that are <br>
        at least four centimeters long, it progresses to vegetative <br>
        stage two, and so forth.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you plant your sunflower in April or May, the vegetative <br>
        phase will occur in May or early June.

             Reproductive Phase</h2>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
        The reproductive phase occurs when a bud forms between the <br>
        plant’s cluster of leaves. The bud may initially have a star<br>
        -like appearance, but once the reproductive phase is complete,<br>
        you’ll see your bud transform into the tall stemmed, yellow <br>
        bloomed plant you know so well.
        <br>
        It takes about thirty days for a sunflower to bloom. The <br>
        reproductive phase will begin in June and end in July or August.

        <p class="bodycopy">
        Once your sunflower is in full bloom, you’ll have around 20 days<br>
        to enjoy the beauty of the flower. The blooming phase provides <br>
        the opportunity for bees to pollinate the flower and fertilize <br>
        the seeds. When the back of the sunflower head turns yellow, <br>
        you’ll know the seeds are ripening.
         <br>
        The blooming phase is the best time to take advantage of your <br>
        sunflower’s yellow blooms. You can put your flowers in a vase, <br>
        gift them in a bouquet or make a wreath for the fall.

            Harvesting Phase</h2>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p class="bodycopy">
        To harvest the seeds of your sunflower, wait until your sunflower <br>
        droops and turns brown. Then, cut the stem leaving four inches from<br>
        the head of the sunflower. You must store the sunflower head upside<br>
        down in a dry and breathable bag.
        <br>
        Your seeds should be ready to harvest within 110 to 125 days after <br>
        you planted the flower. This means that if you planted your seeds in <br>
        May, your sunflower will die in early or mid-August and you should <br>
        have ready-to-harvest seeds in late-August or September. Because <br>
        sunflowers are annual plants, they must be replanted year after year.

            <li>Support sunflowers with staking if they grow over three feet.</li>
            <li>Use barrier devices around the sunflowers to deter wildlife during harvest.</li>
            <li>Check the back of the flower head for yellowing to identify seed ripening.</li>
            <li>Hang flower heads upside down in warm dry place to harvest seeds.</li>
