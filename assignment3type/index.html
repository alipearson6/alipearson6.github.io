    Sunflowers are famous for their tall stems and bright,<br> 
    yellow blooms. Aside from the flower’s beauty, its seeds <br> 
    are highly nutritious. Although sunflowers grow best in <br> 
    full sun, they’re a tough plant and can withstand dry <br> 
    climates and most soil types. Beginner and experienced <br> 
    gardeners alike will enjoy the minimal care required to <br> 
    grow a sunflower from a seedling to full maturity.<br> 
    <br>
    Sunflowers bloom throughout the summer and early fall.<br> 
    You can read through the various phases of a sunflower’s <br> 
    life cycle to learn how to harvest and use sunflowers <br> 
    in everyday life. Gifting sunflowers, for example, is <br> 
    a great way to show a friend or loved one how much you <br> 
    care. The vibrant color of this well-known plant will <br> 
    surely brighten any room.

            All Begins With a Seed
    </h1>
    <h2> Germination </h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        Once you plant your sunflower seeds, the germination <br>
    phase of the flower’s life cycle will begin. This phase<br>
    takes up to eight days. During germination, roots will<br>
    develop from the seed and a shoot will push through the <br>
    surface of the soil. The shoot is looking for sunlight <br>
    because all plants need sunlight to grow. Germination <br>
    usually occurs from mid-April to late-May, depending on <br>
    when you plant your seeds.
</p>
</body>

<br>

<head>
    <h2>Vegetative Phase</h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        After germination, the vegetative phase of the sunflower’s <br>
        life cycle occurs. Your plant will still be a seedling for <br>
        close to 13 days after it breaks through the soil. This <br>
        initial part of the vegetative phase is called vegetative <br>
        emergence.
    <br>
        Once the plant forms its first leaf that’s at least four <br>
        centimeters long, the plant is officially in vegetative <br>
        stage one (V1). When the plant grows two leaves that are <br>
        at least four centimeters long, it progresses to vegetative <br>
        stage two (V2), and so forth.
    <br>
        If you plant your sunflower in April or May, the vegetative <br>
        phase will occur in May or early June.
    </p>
</body>

    <h2>Reproductive Phase</h2>
<body>
    <p>
        <div>
        The reproductive phase occurs when a bud forms between the <br>
        plant’s cluster of leaves. The bud may initially have a star<br>
        -like appearance, but once the reproductive phase is complete,<br>
        you’ll see your bud transform into the tall stemmed, yellow <br>
        bloomed plant you know so well.
        </div>
        It takes about thirty days for a sunflower to bloom. The <br>
        reproductive phase will begin in June and end in July or August.
    </p>

    <h1>A Blooming Sunflower</h1>
    <h2>Adult Phases</h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        Once your sunflower is in full bloom, you’ll have around 20 days<br>
         to enjoy the beauty of the flower. The blooming phase provides <br>
         the opportunity for bees to pollinate the flower and fertilize <br>
         the seeds. When the back of the sunflower head turns yellow, <br>
         you’ll know the seeds are ripening.
         <br>
        The blooming phase is the best time to take advantage of your <br>
        sunflower’s yellow blooms. You can put your flowers in a vase, <br>
        gift them in a bouquet or make a wreath for the fall.
</p>

    <h2>Harvesting Phase</h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        To harvest the seeds of your sunflower, wait until your sunflower <br>
        droops and turns brown. Then, cut the stem leaving four inches from<br>
        the head of the sunflower. You must store the sunflower head upside<br>
        down in a dry and breathable bag.
          <br>
        Your seeds should be ready to harvest within 110 to 125 days after <br>
        you planted the flower. This means that if you planted your seeds in <br>
        May, your sunflower will die in early or mid-August and you should <br>
        have ready-to-harvest seeds in late-August or September. Because <br>
        sunflowers are annual plants, they must be replanted year after year.

    <h1>Growing Tips for Sunflowers</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <li>
        <ul>
        Water Sunflowers regularly during the essential growth period.<br>
        If you plant the sunflowers in poor soil, add a slow-acting fertliizer.<br>
        Support sunflowers with staking if they grow over three feet.<br>
        Use barrier devices around the sunflowers to deter wildlife during harvest.<br>
        Check the back of the flower head for yellowing to identify seed ripening.<br>
        Hang flower heads upside down in warm dry place to harvest seeds.<br>
        </ul>
    </li>
