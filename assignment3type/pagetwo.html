            Once you plant your sunflower seeds, the germination <br>
            phase of the flower’s life cycle will begin. This phase<br>
            takes up to eight days. During germination, roots will<br>
            develop from the seed and a shoot will push through the <br>
            surface of the soil. The shoot is looking for sunlight <br>
            because all plants need sunlight to grow. Germination <br>
            usually occurs from mid-April to late-May, depending on <br>
            when you plant your seeds.<br>
        <br>
            After germination, the vegetative phase of the sunflower’s <br>
            life cycle occurs. Your plant will still be a seedling for <br>
            close to 13 days after it breaks through the soil. This <br>
            initial part of the vegetative phase is called vegetative <br>
            emergence.<br>
        <br>
            Once the plant forms its first leaf that’s at least four <br>
            centimeters long, the plant is officially in vegetative <br>
            stage one. When the plant grows two leaves that are <br>
            at least four centimeters long, it progresses to vegetative <br>
            stage two, and so forth. If you plant your sunflower in April <br>
            or May, the vegetative phase will occur in May or early June.<br>
        <br>
            The reproductive phase occurs when a bud forms between the <br>
            plant’s cluster of leaves. The bud may initially have a star<br>
            -like appearance, but once the reproductive phase is complete,<br>
            you’ll see your bud transform into the tall stemmed, yellow <br>
            bloomed plant you know so well.<br>

    It takes about thirty days for a sunflower to bloom. The <br>
    reproductive phase will begin in June and end in July or August.
